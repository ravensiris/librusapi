* librusapi - A Librus Synergia scraper

Goal of this project is to free students from the limitations of Librus Synergia software
mainly: giving the user *fresh* information unlike their mobile app that can only
refresh every *3h* or so.

* Tech used
- written in =python= developed with =3.9= in mind
- =requests= library for fetching data, mainly html
- =BeautifulSoup4= library for parsing the data
** Development specific
- =mypy= for type checking
- =pytest= for running tests
- =pdoc= for creating html documentation

* Quick start
  Example usage of the API
** Getting the timetable
  #+begin_src python
    from librusapi.token import get_token
    from librusapi import timetable

    token = get_token('username', 'password')
    lesson_units = timetable.lesson_units(token)

    for lu in lesson_units:
        print(lu)
  #+end_src

* Working on the project

  #+begin_src sh
  git clone https://github.com/ravensiris/librusapi
  cd librusapi
  python -m venv venv
  # This may be different depending on your operating system and shell
  source ./venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  # Installing as an editable library
  pip install -e .
  #+end_src

Now you can import =librusapi= in your project
